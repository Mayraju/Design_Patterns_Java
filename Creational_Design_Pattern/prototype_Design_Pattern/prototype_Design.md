## ProtoType Design Pattern

1.  The Prototype design pattern in Java allows creating new objects by cloning existing objects,instead of creating new ones from scratch.
2.  It is useful when the object creation process is expensive and time-consuming.
3.  The pattern provides an efficient way to create multiple copies of an object while reducing the cost of object creation.

**To understand the protoType Design Pattern, we need to have some knowledge on shallow copy and deep copy**
